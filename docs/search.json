Each survey is a multispecies survey that collects data on the distribution, abundance, and biological characteristics of fish, crab, and other resources to inform groundfish stock assessment and management. These fishery-independent surveys are conducted in the summer aboard contracted commercial fishing vessels. Specifics regarding each of the surveys can be found below.\n\n\n\nSorting and weighing fish on deck on the 2022 Bering Sea groundfish survey aboard the F/V Alaska Knight.

    "text": "Data workflow from boat to production\nOrganisms first need to be collected aboard the vessel before data can be entered into tablets.\nThe objective of this process is to take raw data, QA/QC and clean these data, curate standard data products for these survey. Please note, through this process we are not providing “data” (what we consider lower level data material; see the data levels section below) but “data products”, which is intended to facilitate the most fool-proof standard interpretation of the data. These data products only use data from standard and validated hauls, and has undergone careful review.\nOnce survey data collected on the vessel has been checked and validated, the gap_products/code/run.R script is used to orchestrate a sequence of programs that calculate the standard data products resulting from the NOAA AFSC GAP bottom trawl surveys. Standard data products are the CPUE, BIOMASS, SIZECOMP, and AGECOMP tables in the GAP_PRODUCTS Oracle schema. The tables are slated to be updated twice a year: once after the survey season following finalization of that summer’s bottom trawl survey data to incorporate the new catch, size, and effort data and once prior to an upcoming survey to incorporate new age data that were processed after the prior summer’s survey season ended. This second pre-survey production run will also incorporate changes in the data due to the specimen voucher process as well as other post-hoc changes in the survey data.\n\nThe data from these surveys constitute a living data set so we can continue to provide the best available data to all partners, stakeholders, and fellow scientists.\n\nDuring each data product run cycle:\n\nVersions of the tables in GAP_PRODUCTS are locally imported within the gap_products repository to compare with the updated production tables. Any changes to a production table will be compared and checked to make sure those changes are intentional and documented.\nUse the gapindex R package to calculate the four major standard data products: CPUE, BIOMASS, SIZECOMP, AGECOMP. These tables are compared and checked to their respective locally saved copies and any changes to the tables are vetted and documented. These tables are then uploaded to the GAP_PRODUCTS Oracle schema.\nCalculate the various materialized views for AKFIN and FOSS purposes. Since these are derivative of the tables in GAP_PRODUCTS as well as other base tables in RACEBASE and RACE_DATA, it is not necessary to check these views in addition to the data checks done in the previous steps."

    "text": "Data Description\nThe Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division (RACE) Groundfish Assessment Program (GAP) of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) conducts fisheries-independent bottom trawl surveys to monitor the condition of the demersal fish and crab stocks of Alaska. These data are developed to describe the temporal distribution and abundance of commercially and ecologically important groundfish species, examine the changes in the species composition of the fauna over time and space, and describe the physical environment of the groundfish habitat. These data are created using the gapindex R package v2.1.0.\nUsers must read and fully comprehend the metadata prior to use. Data should not be used beyond the limits of the source scale. Acknowledgement of NOAA, as the source from which these data were obtained, in any publications and/or other representations of these data, is suggested. These data are compiled and approved annually after each summer survey season. The data from previous years are unlikely to change substantially once published. Some survey data are excluded, such as non-standard stations, surveys completed in earlier years using different/non-standard gear, and special tows and non-standard data collections."

For example “https://apex.psmfc.org/akfin/data_marts/gap_products/gap_biomass” is the base url to get data from the akfin_biomass table. Web services linked to large tables have mandatory parameters to reduce data download size.

The knowledge, experiences, and insights have been instrumental in expanding the scope of our science and knowledge to encompass the many issues that face this important ecosystem. We appreciate feedback from those residing in the region that are willing to share their insights and participation in an open dialog about how we can improve our collective knowledge of the ecosystem and the region.\nWe would like to thank the many communities of the Bering Strait region and their members who have helped contribute to this document. The knowledge, experiences, and insights of the people of the Bering Strait region have been instrumental in expanding the scope of our science and knowledge to encompass the many issues that face this important ecosystem. We appreciate feedback from those residing in the region that are willing to share their insights, including the local names used for the species covered by this document, identifying species of interest or concern that should be included in this document, and participation in an open dialog about how we can improve our collective knowledge of the ecosystem and the region.\nNOAA Fisheries Alaska Fisheries Science Center’s work is conducted in the waters and along the coastlines of Alaska, which include the traditional home lands and waters of the Inupiat, Yupiit, Siberian Yupiit, Unangax, Alutiiq/Sugpiaq, Eyak, Dena’ina Athabascan, Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian who have stewarded their lands and waters since time immemorial. We are indebted to these peoples for their wisdom and knowledge of their lands and waters.\nThis document was prepared in the greater Seattle area, which are the traditional lands of the Coast Salish people, including the Duwamish people, past and present. We are grateful for their continued sharing of vision, wisdom, values, and leadership.\nThis quarto book is based off the NOAA-quarto-book GitHub repo designed by Eli Holmes and the similar data product book for the Groundfish Assessment Program.\nThis repo and GitHub Action was based on the tutorial by Openscapes quarto-website-tutorial by Julia Lowndes and Stefanie Butland."
