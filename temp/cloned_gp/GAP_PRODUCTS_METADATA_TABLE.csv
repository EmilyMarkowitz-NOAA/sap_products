taxon_groups_description,sentence,GAP_PRODUCTS.TAXONOMIC_CLASSIFICATION subsetted for taxonomic classifications accepted by the GAP bottom trawl survey and added GROUP_CODE to denote taxonomic aggregations.
survey_design_description,sentence,"This table contains for a given survey (via SURVEY_DEFINITION_ID) and survey year (YEAR), which version (DESIGN_YEAR) of the AREA_IDs that were used to calculate the various standard data products."
metadata_table_description,sentence,This table is used to string together the various table comments for the tables in GAP_PRODUCTS.
metadata_column_description,sentence,This table is used to string together the various field comments for the tables in GAP_PRODUCTS.
stratum_groups_description,sentence,"Lookup table for which strata are contained within a given subarea, INPFC or NMFS management area, or region for the Aleutian Islands, Gulf of Alaska, and Bering Sea shelf and slope bottom trawl surveys."
taxonomic_confidence_description,sentence,"The quality and specificity of field identifications for many taxa have fluctuated over the history of the surveys due to changing priorities and resources. The matrix lists a confidence level for each taxon for each survey year and is intended to serve as a general guideline for data users interested in assessing the relative reliability of historical species identifications on the bottom trawl survey. Quality Codes: 1: High confidence and consistency. Taxonomy is stable and reliable at this level, and field identification characteristics are well known and reliable. 2: Moderate confidence. Taxonomy may be questionable at this level, or field identification characteristics may be variable and difficult to assess consistently. 3: Low confidence. Taxonomy is incompletely known, or reliable field identification characteristics are unknown. NA: Unassessed. Taxonomy quality has not been assessed."
