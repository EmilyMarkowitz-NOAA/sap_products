Each survey is a multispecies survey that collects data on the distribution, abundance, and biological characteristics of fish, crab, and other resources to inform groundfish stock assessment and management. These fishery-independent surveys are conducted in the summer aboard contracted commercial fishing vessels. Specifics regarding each of the surveys can be found below. \n\n![Sorting and weighing fish on deck on the 2022 Bering Sea groundfish survey aboard the F/V Alaska Knight.

The code in this repository is regularly being updated and improved. Please refer to [releases](https://github.com/EmilyMarkowitz-NOAA/sap_products/releases) for finalized products and project milestones.\n\n> At this time, these master [production](https://afsc-gap-products.github.io/gap_products/content/product-intro.html) and [AKFIN](https://afsc-gap-products.github.io/gap_products/content/akfin-intro.html) tables are **provisional and we are welcoming feedback before the 2024 survey season.** We look forward to hearing from you. Do not hesitate to reach out (to us at either [nmfs.afsc.gap.metadata@noaa.gov](nmfs.afsc.gap.metadata@noaa.gov) or [GitHub issues](https://github.com/EmilyMarkowitz-NOAA/sap_products/issues), especially if you find discrepancies in the data or want to suggest improvements to infrastructure. Thank you in advance for your collaboration and partnership with us as we develop our future data universe.\n\n## User Resources\n\n-   [Groundfish Assessment Program Bottom Trawl Surveys](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/science-data/groundfish-assessment-program-bottom-trawl-surveys)\n-   [AFSC’s Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/resource-assessment-and-conservation-engineering-division)\n-   [All AFSC Research Surveys](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/ecosystems/alaska-fish-research-surveys)\n-   [Survey code books](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/groundfish-survey-species-code-manual-and-data-codes-manual)\n-   [Publications and Data Reports](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/)\n-   [Research Surveys conducted at AFSC](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/ecosystems/alaska-fish-research-surveys)\n\n## Cite this data\n\nUse the below bibtext citations, as cited in our group's [citation repository](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/citations/blob/main/cite/bibliography.bib) for citing the data created and maintained in this repository.
