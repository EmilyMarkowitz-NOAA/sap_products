## AFSC Bottom Trawl Surveys

AFSC bottom trawl surveys are conducted by the AFSC’s Groundfish Assessment Program and Shellfish Assessment Program and are conducted in the [Gulf of Alaska](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/ecosystems/alaska-fish-research-surveys#gulf-of-alaska-bottom-trawl-survey), [Aleutian Islands](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/ecosystems/alaska-fish-research-surveys#aleutian-islands-bottom-trawl-survey), [Eastern Bering Sea Slope](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/ecosystems/alaska-fish-research-surveys#eastern-bering-sea-upper-continental-slope-bottom-trawl-survey), [Eastern Bering Sea Shelf](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/ecosystems/alaska-fish-research-surveys#eastern-bering-sea-shelf-bottom-trawl-survey), and [Northern Bering Sea](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/ecosystems/alaska-fish-research-surveys#northern-bering-sea-shelf-bottom-trawl-survey). Each survey is a multispecies survey that collects data on the distribution, abundance, and biological characteristics of fish, crab, and other resources to inform groundfish stock assessment and management. These fishery-independent surveys are conducted in the summer aboard contracted commercial fishing vessels. Specifics regarding each of the surveys can be found below.

## Documentation Objective

As part of our commitment to open science, reproducibility, and transparency, we provide this  metadata guide to compliment our public-domain data. 

> Please consider this resource to be a **Living Document**. The code in this repository is regularly being updated and improved. Please refer to [releases](`r paste0(link_repo, '/releases')`) for finalized products and project milestones.

> At this time, these master [production](https://afsc-gap-products.github.io/gap_products/content/product-intro.html) and [AKFIN](https://afsc-gap-products.github.io/gap_products/content/akfin-intro.html) tables are **provisional and we are welcoming feedback before the 2024 survey season.** We look forward to hearing from you. Do not hesitate to reach out (to us at either [nmfs.afsc.gap.metadata@noaa.gov](nmfs.afsc.gap.metadata@noaa.gov) or [GitHub issues](`r paste0(link_repo, "/issues")`), especially if you find discrepancies in the data or want to suggest improvements to infrastructure. Thank you in advance for your collaboration and partnership with us as we develop our future data universe.
